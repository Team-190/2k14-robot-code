//This is the Collect commandgroup
//It is used in both teleop and auto
//It first brings the arm into position, closes the claw, and starts the rollers
//Then when the ball is collected, it goes to the Up position
//I auto, the timeout method is called to prevent the robot from
//not getting mobility points

//NOTE: when you want the collect command to go to Stored when ended
//use the one with the boolean
